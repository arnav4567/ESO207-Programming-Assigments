This repository contains our team's([Arnav Gupta](https://github.com/arnav4567), [Kushagra Sharma](https://github.com/RoyalPhoenix-bot)) submissions to the assignments of the 2021-22 Sem I offering of the course ESO207A. 

#### Assignment 1
+ Addition of two polynomials of degree `n` and `m`. Overall Complexity of the code: `O(n+m)`.
+ Multiplication of two polynomials of degree `n` and `m`. Overall Complexity of code: `O(nÂ²m)`.
#### Assignment 2
+ Implementing the merging of two `2-3 trees` in `O(h1+h2)` time, where `h1` and `h2` are the heights of the two trees. [Given, minimum element of second tree is less than the maximum element of the first tree].
#### Assignment 3
+ Implemented bipartition of an undirected connected graph. Overall Complexity: `O(V+E)`.
